# Signal

### Use past tense

Signals go first and donâ€™t use parentheses unless they pass function parameters. Use the past tense to name signals. Append `_started` or `_finished` if the signal corresponds to the beginning or the end of an action.

```text
signal moved
signal talk_started(parameter_name)
signal talk_finished
```
